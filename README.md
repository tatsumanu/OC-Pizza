# OC-Pizza
Documentation fonctionnelle et technique

Work for a french food retailer (pizza). The client wanted a new solution for the commercial part (= selling pizzas)
as for the internal part (= the back office). We provided them with a fully crafted python/Django styled website, with new
possibilities for them as for the clients. 

This is the functionnal and technical documentation we wrote for them as our preliminary work.

Note: the docs are wrote in french ;)
